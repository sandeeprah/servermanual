Creating a New Django Site Droplet on DigitalOcean
==================================================

Django, Postgresql, Gunicorn and Nginx together form a formidable configuration for a webapplication server. DigitalOcean now provides a one click facility to create a new droplet with all of this setup. As prerequisite you need to have a DigitalOcean account. From the console initiate Create Droplet. For details refer to the url below:




1. Select the image e.g. Ubuntu18.04
2. Select the one click app option and select Django
3. Give an easy name to the droplet which will also serve as the localhost name e.g.vanguard
4. Do not set SSH. This way you will get the root password on your email.

With the above steps, digitalocean would do an automatic setup with django, postgresql, gunicorn and nginx


A digitalocean guide for one-click django installation can be found `here <https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/django/#start>`_

Login from the terminal follow the procedure for initial login

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ssh root@droplet-ip-address

You will be prompted to change the password immediately after login.

When configuring the droplet few users are automatically created which are django and postgres As root user change the password of django to something you can remember:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ passwd django

The django username and password can be used to ftp files to the server in the website

In order to avoid loggin in as root, provide sudo privileges to the django user  using the command

.. code-block:: bash

  $ adduser siteadmin
  $ usermod -aG sudo siteadmin
